## PROJECT 1
## **Overview**
Logistic Regression is a widely used method for classifying categorical outcomes, particularly in binary scenarios such as Yes/No, Positive/Negative, or Success/Failure. This project focuses on implementing logistic regression in R to predict binary outcomes based on a set of predictor variables.

## **Implementation**
The project provides a practical example of logistic regression using R and a dataset related to predicting customers' acceptance of a personal loan offer. It covers steps such as data preprocessing, model fitting, prediction, and evaluation using a confusion matrix and decile chart.

## **Key Steps**
Data Preparation: Loaded the dataset and preprocessed it as needed.
Model Training: Used the glm() function in R with family = "binomial" to fit the logistic regression model.
Prediction: Utilized the trained model to predict probabilities or class labels for new data.
Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using a confusion matrix, decile chart, and other relevant metrics.

## PROJECT 2
Classification and Regression Trees (CART) Project
## **Overview**
This project focuses on the implementation and application of Classification and Regression Trees (CART), a versatile and interpretable data-driven method used for both classification and prediction tasks. CART provides clear decision rules by recursively partitioning the dataset based on predictor variables.

## **Usage**
Setup: Ensure you have the required libraries (e.g., rpart, rpart.plot) installed in your R environment.
Data Preparation: Loaded dataset and preprocessed it as needed.
Model Training: Used the rpart() function to build a classification or regression tree.
Visualization: Utilized the prp() function to visualize the generated tree.
Parameter Tuning: Experimented with parameters like cp and minsplit to balance tree complexity and performance.
Evaluation: Assessed the model's performance using confusion matrices on training and validation datasets.

## PROJECT 3
Classification
## **Overview**
This project focuses on the implementation of the k-nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm for classification tasks. The k-NN algorithm is a versatile method that can be used for predicting categorical outcomes based on the similarity of records in a dataset. In this context, the project specifically addresses the classification of households into "owner" or "non-owner" categories.

The k-NN algorithm can be employed for classification or prediction tasks. In this project, we delve into its application for categorical outcome classification. The fundamental idea is that individuals are likely to belong to a particular category based on the characteristics of their nearest neighbors in the dataset.

## **Procedure**
Assumed the outcome variable Y has two levels: Y1 and Y2.
A new record is labeled as Y1 or Y2 based on its predictors (X1, X2, ...).
Calculated the distance from the new record to existing records (neighbors).
Identified the k records with the shortest distance (closest neighbors).
Determined the neighborhood borders (parameter k) and assessed the majority class among neighbors.
Labeled the new record with the majority class.
